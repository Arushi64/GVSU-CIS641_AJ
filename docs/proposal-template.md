# Introduction

(In 2-4 paragraphs, describe your project concept)
- detection sprites
- keep score and track losses and wins or lives
- add music 
- determine win or game over criteria ( max game duration of 2 mins or max high score of TBD)
- For our game, we plan on making something similar to 2D Super Mario. We spoke about adding various levels to the game that would increase in difficulty and adding different enemy sprits throughout the progression. The game may also change in scenery throughout the various levels depending on what we are able to do with our code. We haven't decided on an official technology that we plan on using yet. We spoke about using Scratch if we are able to do so, otherwise we are leaning towards PyGame. We are also planning to add background music to the game and adding the ability to keep track of losses and wins. The game is also expected to have some form of time limit to finish each level.

# Anticipated Technologies

(What technologies are needed to build this project)
- PyGame
- Scratch(maybe?)
- GitHub
- Android Studio

# Method/Approach

(What is your estimated "plan of attack" for developing this project)
- Meeting once a week to start off ( Every Monday @7pm)
- Assign tasks to every group member and check in during class on Wed and check in during weekly meeting 
- Use Issues on GitHub to assign tasks and track project progress

Steps to break the project down: (create issues for these)
- Step 1: Getting Scratch, Setting It Up and Finding Images
- Step 2: Set Up Your Characters/ Sprites( main character and enemies)
- Step 3: Make Your Flooring, Border and Background
- Step 4: Write code for every character and suceeding levels 
- Step 5: Test Code Every Step of the way

# Estimated Timeline

(Figure out what your major milestones for this project will be, including how long you anticipate it *may* take to reach that point)
- 2nd October- Have a basic idea of game requirements and design by this date
- 9th October- Start working on the game and have backgrounds and images operational  
- 31st October- Have characters and sprites operational on the first level ( have necessary reqs done by this time)
- Work on adding extra features we would like to add to the game, changing difficulty of the levels, etc.
- Mid November: make sure game is fully operational and test for bugs 
# Anticipated Problems

(Describe any problems you foresee that you will need to overcome)
- Not everyone on the team has extensive developing experience
- Trying to figure out everyone's roles
