# Nostalgia Development

This project is designed to highlight similar features that many users found enjoyable in various Mario 2D platformers from the late 1990s and early 2000s. Nostalgia Development developed a game that roped in familiar elements of 2D platformers but also included familiar characters that would bring forth nostalgia for users.
